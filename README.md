- Real-time time update every second.
- Minimal UI with the ability to exit the application from the menu.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BankingHelperApp.git
   ```

2. Open the project in **Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open BankingHelperApp.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run the app on your macOS device.

## Usage

Once the app is running, it will appear as an icon in your macOS menu bar displaying the current time for **Los Angeles (LA)** and **New York (NY)** in real-time.

- Close the Xcode, you'll see the timer closing
- `command + space` and search by: MenuBarApp

## Manual Reordering in macOS Menu Bar

If you want to reorder system-wide icons (like Wi-Fi, Battery, etc.), follow these steps:

1. **Hold the `Command (⌘)` key** on your keyboard.
2. **Click and drag any icon** in the menu bar (including the app's time display).
3. **Release the icon** when it’s in the desired position.

This works for most apps that place icons in the macOS menu bar.
